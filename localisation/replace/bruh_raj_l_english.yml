However although some elements of Indias upper elite recongize that the invaders may prompt a chance for indepedance this mood has swiftly been eroded. The question is how quickly can we remove the new oprressor."
tfv_raj.213.a:0 "A Even Worse Oppressor"

tfv_raj.214.t:0 "A New Direction?"
tfv_raj.214.d:0 "The Course of the Indian nation has came to a stop. However it does not mean it cannot be reborn here and now. However the means and direction to the liberation of India is not as clear. Britain stands as the most ideal candidate to aid in our efforts, inadditon to that many of the military staff and personnel that were lost could be sought out. However there is the theory that time will reveal the true nature of the Foreign Occuipiers and thus a grass route rebellion could be easy way back to Liberation."

tfv_raj.214.b:0 "We Should Work With Britain"

tfv_raj.215.d:0 "It is clear that since the capitulation of the Indian nation that control was loose. However its been in recent months and years that the control they had was getting worse. Now it seems that it has become clear with local millitas in open revolt and claim to be operating along side Indian National Congress which had been somewhat complacent in working with the Foriegn Occupiers."
