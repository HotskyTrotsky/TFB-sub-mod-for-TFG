# TFB sub mod for TFG


current changes include:

Patch 1:

-Poland is guaranteed by UK from game start

-Rubber refs will no longer be nuked (i.e all 3 levels will not be instantly blown up but will take longer if targeted)

-Production cost of steel refs reduced from 12000 - 10000

-excavation tech 2 enables level 2 steel refinery and excavation tech 3 enables level 3 steel refinery

-Spain has been given 100 trains at start to improve supply during civil war

-free divisions (no xp to make)

-free tank and ship template designing (no xp to design)

-Slight increase in reinforce rate of divisions for manpower and equipment.

-No pause mod which prevents the game speed from slowing down when someone is lagging.

-Increase the number of fighters being shot down in fighter vs fighter trades.

-Changed armor/piercing damage thresholds to be in lines of 5%. (For example if you have piercing 45% of the tank you will do 45% damage, 5% = 5% ect. This ranges from 0% to 100%) This change is a test to make it more fitting like hardness works although it's not a perfect replica of that system.

-AI will always accept attache therefore you do not need to improve relations.

-reduced attache cost from 100 pp and 50 cp to 50 pp and 25 cp

-Host tool implemented

-Reduced fuel consumption of HQ and logistic companies

-2 tile El-Alamein

-reduced heavy attack on medium guns:

MedGun1 = 12 - 8

MedGun2 = 15 - 12

MedGun3 = 20 - 16

MedGun4 = 25 - 20

-Reduced Ship Torpedo attack (not sub):

Torpedo1 = 18 - 12

Torpedo2 = 24 - 16

Torpedo3 = 30 - 20

Torpedo4 = 36 - 24

These naval changes will almost certainly change however its to restrict a Heavy cruiser and light cruiser meta from developing.


Further changes with patch 2:

-Combat width changes to fit 30w:

Forrest = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 60

Urban = 140 to 120 reinforce = 20 - 30

Dense Urban = 200 to 180 reinforce = 40 - 30

Jungle = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 30

Marsh = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 30

-Now able to assign CAS to divisions

-Changes to field marshal:

Offensive doctrine now gives: 5% terrain penalty reduction

Defensive doctrine: 30% max entrenchment to 25%

-Artillery tech 2,3,4 stat buffs give 2.5% attack to light, medium, heavy tanks (in total 7.5% by 1942)

-Infantry equipment 1,2,3,4,5 have had defence value reduced by 2.

Inf1 14 to 12

inf2 16 to 14

inf3 18 to 16

inf4 20 to 18

inf5 24 to 22

-Reduced the defence upgrade percentage of infantry equipment from 10% per level to 5%

Overall this should reduce the amount of defence across the board (not drastically we are talking between 20-40 defence per infantry division)


Patch 3 (very small changes)

-Brought files up to date with TFB changes made on 22/03/2023 (changes to sonar, soviet focus tree ect.. just look at the change logs of Regular TFB)

-changes to Hungary and Romania focus tree that allows some focuses to continue even if requirements are not met

-Made changes to fuel consumption of infantry and support companies that were made in TFB to fix the issue with no training without fuel (this is a TFB change)

-Infantry equipment  reduced by a further 1 defence per tech

-Fix Host tool

-Japan will now auto declare war on China

-Naval training now does not damage ships

-Removed fuel consumption when training units (this likely won't fix any problems relating to xp or even units not training)

-Moved 750 oil of 900 oil from Romania into 3 states in Libya, Romania keeps the resource rights to these states.

-Phillipines is now annexable by USA after France has Capitulated

-Malaysia and DEI will no longer make units

-Multiple division training changes such as: Max level from 2 to 4, A peace time training idea to all nations, Reduced minimum requirements for training new divisions. 

-Juggle tech added

-Changes to artillery tech to have cannons unlocked in the middle path, however there is an increase cost to that tech and date changes to compensate less research. It does make the tech tree wacky....;)

-Added decisions for UK and Italy on developing supply in Africa depending on who is pushing


Patch 5 (continued for TFB update)

- Changed the IC cost of everything from 20% more expensive to only 10%

-Kept millitary factory construction cost the same (not increased unlike in TFB)

5% to 7.5%
8% to 10%
8% to 12%

-Logistical horse and motorised is now improved by researching the logistics tech however it does now require more equipment and has been reduced from -50% to -40%

-Field Hospital techs have had experience loss reduction increased by roughly 5% each level

-Reduced air loses from trainning

-Reduced accident base chance

-Tank design companies will be applied more broadly to tank types (note not all but most)

-Cavalry leader advisors no longer grant bonus to mechanised (they still boost motorised and cavalry)
