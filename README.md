# TFB sub mod for TFG


current changes include:

Patch 1:

-Poland is guaranteed by UK from game start

-Rubber refs will no longer be nuked (i.e all 3 levels will not be instantly blown up but will take longer if targeted)

-Production cost of steel refs reduced from 12000 - 10000

-excavation tech 2 enables level 2 steel refinery and excavation tech 3 enables level 3 steel refinery

-Spain has been given 100 trains at start to improve supply during civil war

-free divisions (no xp to make)

-free tank and ship template designing (no xp to design)

-Slight increase in reinforce rate of divisions for manpower and equipment.

-No pause mod which prevents the game speed from slowing down when someone is lagging.

-Increase the number of fighters being shot down in fighter vs fighter trades.

-Changed armor/piercing damage thresholds to be in lines of 5%. (For example if you have piercing 45% of the tank you will do 45% damage, 5% = 5% ect. This ranges from 0% to 100%) This change is a test to make it more fitting like hardness works although it's not a perfect replica of that system.

-AI will always accept attache therefore you do not need to improve relations.

-reduced attache cost from 100 pp and 50 cp to 50 pp and 25 cp

-Host tool implemented

-Reduced fuel consumption of HQ and logistic companies

-2 tile El-Alamein

-reduced heavy attack on medium guns:

MedGun1 = 12 - 8

MedGun2 = 15 - 12

MedGun3 = 20 - 16

MedGun4 = 25 - 20

-Reduced Ship Torpedo attack (not sub):

Torpedo1 = 18 - 12

Torpedo2 = 24 - 16

Torpedo3 = 30 - 20

Torpedo4 = 36 - 24

These naval changes will almost certainly change however its to restrict a Heavy cruiser and light cruiser meta from developing.


Further changes with patch 2:

-Combat width changes to fit 30w:

Forrest = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 60

Urban = 140 to 120 reinforce = 20 - 30

Dense Urban = 200 to 180 reinforce = 40 - 30

Jungle = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 30

Marsh = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 30

-Now able to assign CAS to divisions

-Changes to field marshal:

Offensive doctrine now gives: 5% terrain penalty reduction

Defensive doctrine: 30% max entrenchment to 25%

-Artillery tech 2,3,4 stat buffs give 2.5% attack to light, medium, heavy tanks (in total 7.5% by 1942)

-Infantry equipment 1,2,3,4,5 have had defence value reduced by 2.

Inf1 14 to 12

inf2 16 to 14

inf3 18 to 16

inf4 20 to 18

inf5 24 to 22

-Reduced the defence upgrade percentage of infantry equipment from 10% per level to 5%

Overall this should reduce the amount of defence across the board (not drastically we are talking between 20-40 defence per infantry division)


Patch 3 (very small changes)

-Brought files up to date with TFB changes made on 22/03/2023 (changes to sonar, soviet focus tree ect.. just look at the change logs of Regular TFB)

-changes to Hungary and Romania focus tree that allows some focuses to continue even if requirements are not met

-Made changes to fuel consumption of infantry and support companies that were made in TFB to fix the issue with no training without fuel (this is a TFB change)


Patch 4:

-Czech tanks are now able to be converted (this applied only to light tanks not being upgradable)

-Infantry equipment  reduced by a further 1 defence per tech

-Field marshal trait for entrenchment further reduced from 25% to 20%

-Infantry radios now give 5% defence instead of 10% per level but also give 5% hard and soft attack instead of 2.5%

-Fix Host tool

-Japan will now auto declare war on China

-Naval training now does not damage ships

-Removed fuel consumption when training units (this likely won't fix any problems relating to xp or even units not training)

-Moved 750 oil of 900 oil from Romania into 3 states in Libya, Romania keeps the resource rights to these states.

-Phillipines is now annexable by USA after France has Capitulated

-Malaysia and DEI will no longer make units
