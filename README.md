# TFB sub mod for TFG


current changes include:

Patch 1:

-Poland is guaranteed by UK from game start

-Rubber refs will no longer be nuked (i.e all 3 levels will not be instantly blown up but will take longer if targeted)

-Production cost of steel refs reduced from 12000 - 10000

-excavation tech 2 enables level 2 steel refinery and excavation tech 3 enables level 3 steel refinery

-Spain has been given 100 trains at start to improve supply during civil war

-free divisions (no xp to make)

-free tank and ship template designing (no xp to design)

-Slight increase in reinforce rate of divisions for manpower and equipment.

-No pause mod which prevents the game speed from slowing down when someone is lagging.

-Increase the number of fighters being shot down in fighter vs fighter trades.

-Changed armor/piercing damage thresholds to be in lines of 5%. (For example if you have piercing 45% of the tank you will do 45% damage, 5% = 5% ect. This ranges from 0% to 100%) This change is a test to make it more fitting like hardness works although it's not a perfect replica of that system.

-AI will always accept attache therefore you do not need to improve relations.

-reduced attache cost from 100 pp and 50 cp to 50 pp and 25 cp

-Host tool implemented

-Reduced fuel consumption of HQ and logistic companies

-2 tile El-Alamein

-reduced heavy attack on medium guns:

MedGun1 = 12 - 8

MedGun2 = 15 - 12

MedGun3 = 20 - 16

MedGun4 = 25 - 20

-Reduced Ship Torpedo attack (not sub):

Torpedo1 = 18 - 12

Torpedo2 = 24 - 16

Torpedo3 = 30 - 20

Torpedo4 = 36 - 24

These naval changes will almost certainly change however its to restrict a Heavy cruiser and light cruiser meta from developing.


Further changes with patch 2:

-Combat width changes to fit 30w:

Forrest = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 60

Urban = 140 to 120 reinforce = 20 - 30

Dense Urban = 200 to 180 reinforce = 40 - 30

Jungle = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 30

Marsh = 80 to 90 reinforce = 40 - 30

-Now able to assign CAS to divisions

-Changes to field marshal:

Offensive doctrine now gives: 5% terrain penalty reduction

Defensive doctrine: 30% max entrenchment to 25%

-Artillery tech 2,3,4 stat buffs give 2.5% attack to light, medium, heavy tanks (in total 7.5% by 1942)

-Infantry equipment 1,2,3,4,5 have had defence value reduced by 2.

Inf1 14 to 12

inf2 16 to 14

inf3 18 to 16

inf4 20 to 18

inf5 24 to 22

-Reduced the defence upgrade percentage of infantry equipment from 10% per level to 5%

Overall this should reduce the amount of defence across the board (not drastically we are talking between 20-40 defence per infantry division)


Patch 3 (very small changes)

-Brought files up to date with TFB changes made on 22/03/2023 (changes to sonar, soviet focus tree ect.. just look at the change logs of Regular TFB)

-changes to Hungary and Romania focus tree that allows some focuses to continue even if requirements are not met

-Made changes to fuel consumption of infantry and support companies that were made in TFB to fix the issue with no training without fuel (this is a TFB change)


Patch 4:

-Czech tanks are now able to be converted (this applied only to light tanks not being upgradable)

-Infantry equipment  reduced by a further 1 defence per tech

-Field marshal trait for entrenchment further reduced from 25% to 20%

-Infantry radios now give 5% defence instead of 10% per level but also give 5% hard and soft attack instead of 2.5%

-Fix Host tool

-Japan will now auto declare war on China

-Naval training now does not damage ships

-Removed fuel consumption when training units (this likely won't fix any problems relating to xp or even units not training)

-Moved 750 oil of 900 oil from Romania into 3 states in Libya, Romania keeps the resource rights to these states.

-Phillipines is now annexable by USA after France has Capitulated

-Malaysia and DEI will no longer make units


Patch 5:

-Upgrade to Host tool

-Multiple division training changes such as: Max level from 2 to 4, A peace time training idea to all nations, Reduced minimum requirements for training new divisions. 

-Juggle tech added

-Changes to artillery tech to have cannons unlocked in the middle path, however there is an increase cost to that tech and date changes to compensate less research. It does make the tech tree wacky....;)

-Added decisions for UK and Italy on developing supply in Africa depending on who is pushing


Patch 5 (continued for TFB update)

- Changed the IC cost of everything from 20% more expensive to only 10%

-Kept millitary factory construction cost the same (not increased unlike in TFB)

-Other than that eveything else in the latest TFB patch is the same


Patch 6

-Removed Itallian Naval designer that gave 20% speed and - 25% naval range

-Removed engine 3 from Itallian starting ships and tech

-Reduced the bonus adminrals gives from defense from -2.5% visability per level to -1%

-Increased the naval hit chances given by fire control (roughly 2.5% - 5% increase depending on tech level)

-Decreased Anti Air from ship modules across the board (includes multiple dual purpose batteries), Anti Air 1 and 2 are much lower but Anti air 3 and 4 scale higher.

-Introduced new logistics which is a merge of hosre-drawn and motorised (bad attempt at making tiny logo included)

-Changes to Manchu AI

-Home guard units that UK spawns are now 30w but will only spawn 26

-UK cannot gain cb on USA through naval treaties

-Reduced peace time trainning to -50%

-Increased Xp loss reduction that field hospitals gives from -10% to -20%


Patch 7

-Removed Wheel suspension

-Made Mechansied suspension only avaible for SPAA

-Added a new suspension which is a watered down version of the wheel suspensions (Halve the stats) which can be used for everything

-Reduced Dozer blades defense from 10 to 7

-Increased hard attack of medium TD1 cannon from 46 to 52 and medium TD2 from 58 to 64

-Increased Research bonus from electrical computer techs as such:
4% to 5%
5% to 7.5%
8% to 10%
8% to 12%

-Logistical horse and motorised is now improved by researching the logistics tech however it does now require more equipment

-Added LW air designer

-Reduced air loses from trainning

-Reduced accident base chance

-Tank design companies will be applied more broadly to tank types (note not all but most)

-Cavalry leader advisors no longer grant bonus to mechanised (they still boost motorised and cavalry)

-Artillery designer now effects pack artillery and motorised rocket artillery

-Fixed Raj focus so that they can't just skip Red Eagle Divison (Roisa your reign of terror is over)

-Set removing modules from existing designs should not cost xp

-Few minor bug fixes with host tool



Patch 8 

-Added air deisgner, It contains changes to base research costs of most techs relating to it.

HA1: Soft attack 28 to 32 Breakthrough 2 to 4
HA2: Soft attack 30 to 34 Breakthrough 5 to 8
HA3: Soft attack 34 to 38 Breakthrough 6 to 10
HA4: Soft attack 40 to 44 Breakthrough 7 to 12

-Change logistics (again i know...) so you can only have 1 at a time so:
Logistics company - cheapest but less supply reduction
Horse-drawn - Requires horses but better than logistics
motorised - requires motorised and fuel
mechanised - requires 5 mechanised and motorised is the best for logistics but requires mechanised researched, it also adds more hp (from 1 to 5)

-Fixed the province Zhengzhou, When china did the floods this tile would retain the flooded modifier even after it was suppose to be removed (aka it would forever have this modifier)

-Hydropnuematic suspensions now gives 5% speed increase

-Removed option to leave USA out of strike west

-Removed decision to annex Vichy if you capture Paris as Free France

-Australia Manpower buff, When at war with Japan they Australia will gain weekly manpower depending on the Malaya barrier spirit.

-Finland now gets weekly manpower for aslong as the winter war is fought.

-Removed decision to gain war goal on nations that have removed naval treaties (I had thought i had allready done this however i was mistaken but it has now been fixed i promise)

-The exploit to gain the bonuses of tank radios as germany has been fixed (Therefore if you have tank radios researched or are researching it you will not gain the tech from the focus but instead gain 35 pp)

-Removed bonus of ground attack from basic light airframe

-Changed the breakthrough debuff from medium cannon 2s from -10 breakthrough to -10%

-SS and Red Guard divisions no longer have TD but an extra medium tank (Same goes for the Heavy and light red guard divisions)

-Increased research cost of cas and strat bombing techs.

-Finland no longer gets strat bombers from purchase aircraft focus.

-Removed cost increase in amphibious tank module

-Soviet politicised military no longer has field marshal promotion cost

-Removed anti air debuff from light SPAA, to compensate medium SPAA get a +20% bonus to AA.

-Military police added to SS and Red Guard divisions.


Patch 11

-Added changes to Soviet focus tree to change red guard division to heavy tank

-Added mech logistics to SS and Red Guard Divisions

-Spaced out Molsey focus tree so that 1 focus was not overlapping (not that it mattered at all)

-Increased damage resistance for Forts, Coastal forts, Ports, Sythentic oil refs, Steel Mills

-Added a new State of the Mediterranean spirit which will give a attack modifier for axis against the soviets depending on how much of africa it owns or how far the allies have pushed into the med (Italy).

-Light Assault gun no longer has reduced soft and hard attack penalty from: -30% hard and -30% soft to: -10% soft and - 15% hard.

-Non Major propoganadas are now 25 pp cost.

-Updated the mod to fit with TFB changes made on the 12/05/2023 (which includes infastructure, Maginot line, El Alamein and africa changes. However there is allready a implemntation of around the maginot adding benelux countries to allies thus was not needed.)

-Fixed State of Med not showing which states matter.

-Updated some missing changes from TFB from 14/05/2023 However this does not include the Germany tank designer (for now).

-Fixed State of Med not increasing when Vichy spawned and takes north africa. To compensate the starting level is reduced by 2.

-Reverted changes to infra cost, and construction bonus. Also reverted production output from military factories.

-Cost for applying medals reduce to 5 pp however the cost of adding another increases is much higher.

Patch 12

-Fixed Imperial confrence

-Added fortressess as in TFB

-Gave the national focus 'Germans are coming" -5% consumer goods, 15% factory output, 5% factory effciency max, 10% effciency growth, 10% resource extraction






Patch 13 

-Reduced the planning debuff from having max intel on local region from -100% to -20% (this can be stacked with other nations i think)

-Commonwealth tanks can mount medium cannon 1 on early hulls.

-Moved the Oil in Africa so that it starts in Moldova (Romania) However they will lose it if italy loses Libya (Bengahzi, Tripoli, Tobruk). The reason being is sometimes Romania would not gain access to the oil due to no legal transport path.




Patch 14

-Buff from Veterancy is decreased

-Minor propaganda changes (increased bonus)

-Pulled number of changes form TFB (Ethiopia changes from 31/06/2023)

-Some other clear housing of code to try and slim down (This may break something however during current testing it seems to be a-okay. Whole purpose was to try keep the mod file small and deleting files needed)

-Australia can no longer annex DEI

-USA does not start with Philippines (both this and the previous changes were not known to happen when implementing No Asia)

-Overhauled No Asia to include USA with a new focus tree which allows it to annex Mexico and Brazil. USA plays more like a minor nation since it’s a reduced state and focus tree is not as strong.

-Added decisions for Romania, Hungry, South Africa, Canada, Australia to annex nations (Romania can annex hungry and Bulgaria, Hungry can annex Romania and Bulgaria, Canada can annex South Africa, UK can annex Australia)

-Added some new division icons as options.

-Potential fix for Romanian oil resetting when a hot join happens. (Difficult to test in single player however, I added a monthly check which should set the idea correlated with amount of oil to the variable set when changing control of state. That way if it does reset after a hot join, it should fix its self after a month.) 

Patch 14.1

-Germany cannot annex vichy until after 1941

-Free France now have focuses to annex Norway, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg if they are Ai at war with germany. This is to try and speed the game up but also remove exiled units.

-Reworked USA No asia focuses tree to be less powerful but also fixed a lot which was not working with the focus tree such as events for elections not firing but also for them to join the allies.

-If UK is capitulated and is AI the decision for france to annex UK is not optional.

-Fixed exiled UK churchil in charge not being able to progress through focus tree.


Patch 15

-Intergrated TFB Changes to Germany tank designer

-Ported over changes made in TFB

Patch 16 as of 18/06/2023
(There was a patch 15 but it only covered minor bug fixes and therefore was not worth mentioning.)
-New highly Experimental Air changes which include:
125 new airframes unquie to nations
air tech trees for: Germany (Hungary, Romania, Finland) Italy (Bulgaria, Spain) UK (Commonwealth nations) USA (Brazil, Mexico) Japan (Manchucko, Siam) Soviets (Mongolia, China) France.
New Modules
New starting aircraft
This is early Alpha version of this and alot of balancing and editing to airframes is needed, there may also be a rework on modules and how they work. Overall this largly just a shell of what it will become, the aim being to keep the air designer but also add the flair of TFB which is nation specific airframes.
Main purpose to make this available is to find bugs and help find a balance. There is a version of the mod in which it does not have the air changes but keeps the other patches in case this does not function and needs to be reworked.

-Fixed M3 lee (or grant *looks down upon in british*) not showing a icon
-Removed some elemets of Host tool (Not needed since TFB added Host tool a while back this is clearing some unnessacy files.)
-Fixed some other changes that happened from TFB
-Made Mexican focus tree all 35 day focuses.
-Reform the Union of britain army focus now gives something (exiled UK communist military path.)

-Introduced no grinding idea for all nations that lowers as the war goes on. (starts at -100% experiance gain to -75% by 1940 june, -50% 1941 june, -25% 1942 june, and is removed by 1943 june.)
-Generals will now gain traits that could be grinded however these are locked behind focuses or events (For example Rommel gets panzer leader and desert fox if germany has more than 5 units in africa, and Japan gains traits for taking Nanjing).
Be aware this is WIP and may not be 100% functional (events are a bit quirky however initial testing shows it should work).


Patch 17
-Fixed a bug which meant Italy and Japan would gain negitive experience for traits.
-Brilliant Strategist no longer gives +20% Leader Experience and any other traits that effect experience gain. However when the No grinding spirit gets reduced in 1940, All units that had brilliant strategist will regain the 20% experiance gain.
-Forgot to mention in previous patch that Free France now has focuses to annex minor nations that have been capitulated (Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourgh. When Netherlands is annexed it will hand over DEI territories to Australia.)
-Fixed Rommel Not getting Panzer leader and Desert Fox, It now works that after fall of france Germany has a year to have atleast 5 divsions in africa.
-Reverted a bunch of changes made to navy (TFB changes however still have the navy Cap)
-Added New events and decisions for UK, Hungary, Germany
UK after finishing army rearmament can now invest into forming the BEF, this will cost 10 civs for 120 days, after the 1st investment it will spawn 2 mixed tank divsions and 6 infantry for france on outbreak of war, after the 2nd investment it will spawn 4 mixed (but slightly better) tank divsions and 13 infantry divsions.
Hungary will now get an event if Soviet union closes in on Budapest and the date is after 1942 jan which will hand over a % of civs and mils (10% and 5% respectivly) and a favourable trade deal to germany and a cost of 8 civs for 200 days. In return Hungary will spawn 3 tank divisions and 5 infantry next to budapest on west side of river. The number of divisions and type of tank is dependant on what germany has researched and whether the date has passed 1943, or 1944.
Germany after greece has capitulated but still controls crete can have an option to launch an invasion of crete with paratroopers so long as they have more than 25 transport planes. If agreed it will spawn 4 20w paratrooper divisons on the island (even if there are divisons on the tile).
Soviet Union can now Invest into divisons of the far east. This costs 8 civs for 120 and comes with 2 investments, However these will only spawn if the axis get close to moscow. The tank template is also dependant on what tech Soviets have researched. (Also only works if they go medium and have the T-34 else if it will spawn light tank divisions). The 1st investment gives 3 medium tanks and 8 Infantry, the 2nd inestment grants a further 3 tanks and 8 Infantry
-Added a Exiled Focus tree for RAJ, Comes with 2 different paths, 1 will build up for a uprising in India, 2 Rapid build up of forces and large amount of equipment to try and take Raj back with the aid of allies.
-Change Romanian Focus tree so that focuses don't cancel if requirements are not met.
-Change some of the middle industry path of Romanian focus tree to be 35 days.
-New Alpha Air changes which include:
125 new airframes unique to nations
air tech trees for: Germany (Hungary, Romania, Finland) Italy (Bulgaria, Spain) UK (Commonwealth nations) USA (Brazil, Mexico) Japan (Manchucko, Siam) Soviets (Mongolia, China) France.
New Modules with them being set into tiers and limiting what each aircraft can have loosely based off history (For example I-16 that Soviets start off with start with cannons) 
New starting aircraft
New events for USA when researching specific airframe
Air designs can be roughly broken up in to 8(ish) types:
1 Fighter
2 CAS which can be split into 2 sub sections that being a dive bomber (Germany gets these early) and a regular CAS (these can have rockets ect)
3 Heavy fighter
4 tactical bombers (which can have long range naval bombing for the patrol type aircraft)
5 strat bomber
6 fighter – bomber (This is your JU88 can have a lot of CAS weapons but also a few tactical bombs or even heavy fighter guns really you do it all but at a high price and not being ideal the best for everything however has decent range for all of them.)
7 Dive Naval bombers – these are capable of doing strat bombing (Very bad but its supposed to represent that carrier naval bombers can help damage coastal forts on the pacific) and naval bombing as well as port strikes.
8 torpedo bombers – only the early versions of torpedoes can be used to port strike and planes can only fit 1 torpedo however they have a higher naval damage but more expensive.
Japanese Aircraft is more interesting in which favouring the army or navy will mean the research time for the aircraft in the opposing section will be longer.
France can gain access (after capitulation) to British fighters and bombers as well American fighters and bombers only if they have been researched by them.
Italy can also gain access to BF109 and JU 87 as well upgrades for the BF109 can be selected if Germany has researched them.This is early Alpha version of this and alot of balancing and editing to airframes is needed, there may also be a rework on modules and how they work. Therefore please go to Suggest Mod changes if you spot somthing broken or too strong or too weak.

Patch 17.1
-Added changes to Manchu Ai
-fixed event for Soviet union far east divisions not spawning
Patch 17.2
-Fixed Bug with Manchu focus tree
-Finally fixed the Romanian Libya Oil breaking when there is a hotjoin.
-Fixed bug with Italy starting CAS
Patch 17.3
-Added Exiled Australia Focus tree
-Fixed Raj and Australia Focus trees that would give an extra 2 research slots after getting the exiled focus tree.
Patch 17.4
-Fixed JU 87 having the agility of a God
-Reduced Torp damage and other naval modules, and increased cost
-Gave Rocket rails a 10-15% cas increase when put on airframe.

Patch 18
-Fixed Australia and Raj not being able to get thier research slot.
-Fixed Mongolia Throat singer bugging out in Minister window.
-Added a means for Japan to do focuses leading up to Strike the west without having the event firing. (I am not certain at all why this bugged out and its highly unlikely it will happen again however for safety measure i have put this in.)
-When you research a new airframe it will automatically create a design for the airframe that you might want (it upgrades your plane as well when you get new tech so all you need to do is change production).Therefore is now possible to play the game without having to look at the air designer, however would be ideal for you to decomission old models. You can still go into the air designer if you want to maximise a particular stat or change somthing for refit, or you think the design it gives you is not to your liking.
-Added decisions to explain the Air tree and designer. (One specific for Japan)
-Uk Air focuses now give broader range of research buffs to later fighter techs and Cas techs.

-Fuel injection 1 and 2 increase thrust.
-Radio Navigation module should increase air superiority by 5% and 10%
-Inceased Air supply conversion scale 0.15 > 0.2 (Help Japans push china)
-Fixed Siege of Budapest Event not firing.
-Reduced focus time of Canada Supply the Empire and its subsquete resource focuses.
-Increased Focus time for a few of Australias Exiled focuses.
-Added Itallian Naval designer which gives:
-25% naval range (Capitals and Screens)
+5% speed (Capitals and Screens)
+10% Heavy attack for capitals
-5% armor (Capitals)
-Put a list of all naval changes from TFB on the steam workshop page (its the last picture).

(Not certain this is an issue since the hull should get the stats from the archetype therefore there is no change to ********)

Patch 19
-Reduced Rubber cost for mech from 20 > 10
-Redcued CAS damage of modules by 1 (total effect is cas has roughly 3-5 less cas damage for some aircraft in total.)
-Fixed Some researched air wings not being buildable due to mismatch of modules
-Merged all TFB changes Therefore there is no differences between TFB and Boogie relating to Navy.
-Possible change that spies don't get captured but instead just injured when doing a operation, spies will be killed if captured on intel gathering (when picked suicide pills).
-Soviet Barb changes which include:
New Reserve system. Removed some focuses that spawned divisions on frontline states and reduced number of spawn ins from focuses. This has been replaced by a ticking reserve system, over time reserves will be built up. Reserves can be spent on spawn in infantry or later on tank divisions (see changes to factory relocation later on). However Reserves will automatically be spent depending on what territory is lost, they will be spawned on defensible frontlines there is no way to avoid spending the reserves so its good idea to keep a good stockpile of them. Reserves can also be provided from focuses.
New Lend lease system. UK and USA will automatically send equipment at the cost of Civs which changes over time and the amount of equipment being sent which is based on how many lend lease routes are open. There are 4 routes: Murmansk, and Arkhangelsk, Persian Corridor, Pacific route. Each route can be closed by the Axis. 1) Murmansk and Arkhangelsk can be closed by either taking the railway up to Murmansk or taking the ports/states. They can also be closed if the UK, USA or Soviets have less than 300 convoys. 2) Persian gulf can only be opened once UK has done operation counternance which in turn can only be done if Allies own africa. But taking Baku or southern Iranian states will also close this route. 3)Pacific Route is only closed if Japan is at war with Soviets. The equipment that the Soviets recieve is dependant on what the UK and USA has researched. If the UK has heavy tanks up to churchill then over time Soviet will get heavy tanks. If UK has Hurricane fighters and Spitfires then soviet will get these. If USA has researched M3 Lee tank and M4 Sherman tank then soviets will also recive these. If USA has researched the P40 Warhawk and the P 39 airacobra then Soviets recive these. NOTE the amount of equipment is dependant on 2 factors, Number of routes open. How long the lend leases has been in effect (I.e Won't start till barb has) Furthermore lend lease will take longer as it goes on so next shipment will take longer than the previous however will contain more equipment dependant on the first factor (number of routes open).
Reworked Industry relocation. When Barb starts any industry in european area of USSR will be relocated over time automatically. The more industry you relocate the quicker you will be able to do Tankograd Focus tree section. Therefore there is a bonus to holding territory closer to the german border.
New Barb missions for Finland, Romania, Germany:
Finland can launch offensives on the Murmansk railway or Leningrad at the cost of equipment. (Murmansk state and the state below it have a state modifier which makes it harder to attack when Finland does a operation in this area it will reduced the debuff)
Romania can damage the forts on Sevastapol and reduced the state modifier for 70 days at the cost of equipment.
Germany now gains factory output for taking its 3 main objectives within a time frame (Kiev, Moscow, Leningrad) for each one will give 2.5% factory output. Other cities such as Smolensk, Bryansk, Kursk, Kharkov, Stalino will give 0.5% factory output. Furthermore taking each baltic state nation will over time give factory output and infantry increasing over time. The same goes for Belarus and Ukraine. However over time the factory output bonus will go down until it reaches 0.
New events for Soviets in which losing Moscow after losing Stalingrad and Leningrad would result in Stalin being killed. If Stalingrad is still owned and surrender progress is not low then Stalin will go missing but dependant on the surrender progress he can be found again or is just presumed dead and a new leader can be picked for USSR
Upon reaching 99% surrender soviets will be peaced out with germany giving up all territory west of urals and Germany creates a puppet like state which takes territory between moscow and the urals. 
Soviets will get the choice to become the ROA or maintain to fight the axis.

Patch 20
-German Atlantic Wall decisions only give 1 coastal fortress instead of 2 per tile.
-German economic fatigue will now keep Barb economic conquest factory output at 0 instead of going into minus.
-Increased the air defence gain from Armor upgrades on planes from 5% per level to 10%
-Decreased resource requirements for Plane modules: Light, Medium, by 2 and 1 steel and aluminium, Self Sealing tanks has had the resource requirements reduced from 4 rubber and 4 aluminium to 2 rubber and 2 aluminium also its range reduction is reduced from -15% to -7.5%.

-Fixed The design that the UK sends of the Hawker Hurricane having no guns
-Fixed Soviet reserve system activating during Winter war.
-USA P-40 Warhawk can now be CAS and it creates a CAS Design when researched.
-Soviets, Finland, Mongolia, Japan, Italy will gain Peace training again after their respective wars.
-Changed values of some dynamic modifiers such as Frozen front, Tough Terrain and tough terrain adapted (these are all linked with Soviet changes and all reduced the debuffs they give by around 50%)
-Fixed some Localisation on Australian exiled tree and added a tool tip for right side purchase equipment from USA Focus.
-Fixed bug when Free France annex Netherlands it gave Indonesia to Australia even if it was owned by Japan.
-Fixed some error log issues (nothing critical just ai not knowing what focus order to do, Gfx bugs ect.)
-Amphibious tanks now get benefits from arty tech the same as tanks
-Added New decisions for Australia to set up defences in South West Asia and Papua, they can only invest into 2 regions unless they do SWPA Protector which will enable them to do another region including Singapore. The bonus provides states with extra local supply and a small defence bonus.
-Removed Core from Malta and added a State modifier which gives supply and defense. It can be improved if UK completes focus defend Malta. Italy also gains a decision to launch operation herkules which will remove the state modifier if Italy has enough Tactical bombers and Germany has enough fighters deployed. It will only be removed for 46 days.

Patch 21
-Pulled changes from TFB:
DEPTH_CHARGES_HIT_PROFILE 100 -> 80
- If the allies deny the Sudetenland Hungary can now access their Turan if the Cezchs have capped
- If the allies deny the Sudetenland Germany can now still do Molotov and Second Vienna award
- Removed the 5% increased bomb vulnerability from each concentrated industry
- Added 5% dockyard output to each dispersed industry tech
- If France is a player but Germany and Italy are AI (AKA in singleplayer) France can now access 2 decisions that will show the Free France or spawn Vichy for testing and experimentation purposes
- Added 1 suppression to all tanks to fix France getting tanks selected for garrisons. Move garrisons up in the queue as well for nations with them that might take a lot of territory to hopefully make the garrisons get picked automatically
- Moved the 8 buildings slots from Mongolian Collectivization to Dornod since they were over cap in the original state anyway
- NAVALBASE_REPAIR_MULT = 0.05 -> 0.07 -- Each level of navalbase building repairs X strength and can repair as many ships as its level
- Depth charges now grant 3/4/5/6% torpedo damage reduction to help dedicated ASW's survive a torpedo hit, without buffing destroyer health to cause problems elsewhere
- Removed Crusier subs
- AIR_WING_MAX_STATS_ATTACK from 300 to 500
- BIGGEST_AGILITY_FACTOR_DIFF from 4 to 5
COMBAT_DAMAGE_SCALE from 0.15 to 0.1
Reduced Naval treaties heavy hull to be inline with TFB
Added 2 new airframes for UK both are naval bombers that are researched in 1940 and 1943.
Added new Naval bomer for Germany in 1937 (Fw 200 Condor) is a long range 4 engined naval bomber.
Reduced the time for Railways to convert from 10 to 5 days (also from 5 to 2 days if its a core state)
Time it takes to relocate supply capital reduced from 10 to 4 days
Removed Armored trains but increased the research cost of both railway gun techs.
Added Hobarts Funnies for South Africa and Canada, these are like red guard division for Soviets, they are a tank template that can be recruited after completeing focuses Black devils (Canada) and south african military college (SAF). This will unlock a dececision which will increase the number of Hobart funnies divisions as well change it to Heavy tank template if desired. The division has a unquie support company which gives the division Naval invasion attack. This means these are a way for South Africa and Canada to convert tanks into amphbious tanks without needing the tech or equipment. However this can only be done after 1941 jan and are limit to 2. It takes 240 days before you can increase the cap again. They are also expensive divisions and have worse naval invasion attack when compared to a Amphibous tank division.
Added Heavy arty research bonus for Hungary
Added a Volunteer cap that means that only Soviet, Germany, Italy, Japan, France (If they do the path) can send at most 5 divisions. (Other natioins like mongolia or bulgaria can send so long as they do the focuses for it)
Requirements for Sending volunters removed so you don't need to spam divisions.
Spainish volunteers to Germany is capped at 13

Patch 22
-Fixed Brazil Capybara
-Fixed France only able to send 1 volunteer to spain
-Reduced Air xp from training aircraft (They will still train but the amount of air xp is reduced)
-Potential fix for ships having no range, This happens when they run out of fuel (but you still have fuel its just not reaching the ships). When a ship runs out of fuel its range was reduced by 75% which in most cases meant they get stuck. This will no longer happen however it will still be slow and certainly die in battle if caught.
-Added a new event for germany when they research the HE 111 airframe in which they can convert existing civllian aircraft into tactical bombers (Basically you use 5 civs for 70 days and get 120 tactical bombers of the HE 111 variant).
-Fixed bug with Malata not getting its state modifier after its recaptured by allies.
-Added some text within the Itallian Air tree to show where cas and naval bombers are
-Fixed one of the Itallian Air frames not giving the cas and naval bomber varient when researched
-Reduced Naval targeting for Dive bombers (roughly 2-4 per airframe)
-Increased Naval damage of torpedo bombers (1-3 increase)
-Fixed Intel removing planning bonus completly now it only removes 20% at max strength.
-Removed Hill on El-alamein and replaced it with desert. 
-Now costs 25 pp to recall volunteers
-France Now gets Early Mob from Election event + 5% more war support as well. (may 1936)
-Fixed some bugs in Soviet air tree (one fighter did not create a airframe and another had the wrong research date)
-Object to Attache removed
-Cost of removing modules set to 0

Patch 23
-Made a bunch of spawn in divisions for Germany and Soviets create templates that are decommissions so they don't clutter division screen.
-Fixed spawn in divisions for soviets spawning on border with iran and Afghanistan (this is the decision to spawn in every frontline tile)
-The Munich confrence events now fire after 1 day and both UK and France have 7 days to pick an option (this prevents allies holding the event for as long as 40 days to now 14 days max)
-Made Soviet reservist spawn ins 30w, however created a new unit of infantry called "Strelki" which is infantry but requires less equipment this way soviets don't get more equipment from spawn ins and should be the same.
-BEF units should now be deletable after france falls.
-Some Soviet Generals start as level 4
-USA Thunder bolt airframe now also creates a fighter design.
-Added new events and missions for UK (and commonwealth) when they lose africa they can choose to pay civs and factory output to rebuild an army to take back africa. Until they do so UK suffers a -5 to naval invasion capacity. Unless they choose to ride it out which will only give -5 naval capcity for a year.

-Pulled changes from TFB :
//
- COMBAT_MULTIPLANE_CAP = 3 -> 2.5 -- How many planes can shoot at each plane on other side ( if there are 100 planes we are attacking COMBAT_MULTIPLANE_CAP * 100 of our planes can shoot )
- ESCORT_FACTOR 4 -> 5
- DISRUPTION_DEFENCE_DEFENCE_FACTOR = 1 -> 0.9
- DISRUPTION_DEFENCE_ATTACK_FACTOR 0.75 -> 0.8 -- % how many max disrupted only planes are allowed to die in a single combat

- Netherlands now has a pair of decisions to swap their capital between the Netherlands and Java to fix supply and trade issues often seen with them
- Fixed portraits/icons/localization for ENG_stewart_menzies, ENG_alan_turing, SOV_invade_germany_idea, SOV_new_officers, Medium TD Gun Category, USA_james_byrne
- Artillery Designer now works for Pack AT
- You are now prevented from making a Heavy SPAA tank, as there is no batallion to use it so it couldn't be used.
